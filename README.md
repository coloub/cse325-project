## Project Overview
The **Academic Task Manager** is a Blazor Server web application designed to help students organize and manage their academic workload in a structured and intuitive way. The application allows users to create academic projects (such as courses or semesters) and manage tasks associated with each project, including due dates and completion status.

This project is developed as part of the CSE 325 course and follows a semester-long incremental development approach aligned with weekly milestones and checkpoints.
